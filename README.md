###How the Numbers Work
####First Digit
This digit goes up whenever I feel that the project has reached a milestone and/or no longer resembles the first version in it's current digit (e.g.: 0.13.3 is completely different from 0.1.0).
####Second Digit
This digit goes up whenever a new feature is added, but if two or more features are added in one group of updates, this digit will still only rise by one. This number resets to 0 when the first digit goes up.
####Third Digit
This digit goes up whenever a bugfix is released. This number resets to 0 when the second digit goes up.
